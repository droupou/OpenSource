                    I have enjoyed camping and backpacking since I was a young Scout. I completed the
                    50 Mile Pack and Paddle while in Scouting which committed me to backpacking for
                    as long as I am able.
		    <p>My daughter has recently gotten into backpacking.  We just got back from Wichita Wildlife Refuge, were we did some bouldering, and camping.  She was facinated by the prariedogs.

                I have been employed working with computers for almost 15 years, and programming
                for over 10 years, in various capacities. I graduated from Oklahoma State University
                in 2005 with a B.S. Computer Science.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was introduced to my first computer in High School by a programming class in which
                we made picture designs move about the screen on an Apple IIe. I learned the BASIC
                language, and was often given additional work by my instructor, who found I rarely
                stopped at the end of an assignment. My rockets always had a bit of extra flourish
                or functionality. I was deeply curious as to how these machines worked, and disassembled
                our home PC within hours of buying it.
            </p>
            <p>
                With my new computer I began visiting Bulleten Board Systems (BBS), which were the
                80's version of facebook. I met people from all over the world, and eventually built
                my own humble BBS. Although I didn't have a lot of visitors, I did learn a lot about
                software, and usability with that experiment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Soon I found I had access to larger systems at Oklahoma State University via friends,
                and I began exploring the internet via gopher. I discovered mudding, and began playing
                with the game as well as on it. I created areas, and quests, and from time to time
                helped the administrator with small tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was around this time that I began assisting others with their computers as well.
                I could be found most summer mornings at the library, fixing their system. I found
                that I had a knack for figuring out how to make the computers around me work. Sometimes
                in ways not always expected by their makers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shortly after starting college I got a job with a company called Technology Specialists.
                We sold network solutions to companies, schools, and government agencies. I was
                responsible for setting up the computers, and installing the networks. This job
                began my career as a technology expert.
            </p>
            <p>
                My main focus has been software development. All of the programs I have used have
                used an MSSQL backend except one program that used MySQL. I have programmed websites
                in HTML, Perl, Javascript as well as executable programs for windows using C++,
                C#, and VB. I have also interfaced with Excel for multiple projects, extending Excel
                past its generally accepted functionality.

                                    moved to the office in Washington D.C. Once there I was asked to assist in administrating

                                <li>SQL Programmer: I am one of four programmers at EverGreen solutions. We create reports

                                    and purchased the software EverGreen currently uses for tracking trouble tickets.
                                    I setup standards, and goals for the support team.</li>
                                <li>Applications Programmer. I am lead programmer in charge of finishing the AptBudget
                                    program using VB .NET. I was responsible for assigning duties to the other programmer
                                    assigned to the program. I am in the process of cleaning up the code. This program
                                    has been sold to a client company who I am currently turning the program over to.</li>
                                <li>Overview: At EverGreen Solutions I began by working on SQL scripted reporting for
                                    YARDI systems. The reports written where large queries designed to draw accounting
                                    and statistical data from the MSSQL back end to the YARDI system. More recently
                                    I was asked to assist in beginning the AptBudget program. During the specification
                                    gathering process, the project was transferred to another employee, who wrote the
                                    program without specifications. At the point the company attempted to sell the project
                                    to Real Page, it was determined that more structured programming was necessary,
                                    and the project was turned over to me to fix the source code. I rewrote a large
                                    portion of the software to use classes, and functions, as well as standardizing
                                    the interface. Once the source code was turned over to Real Page, I began writing
                                    documentation describing what the program was supposed to do. I wrote a report parser
                                    that allowed users to use XML to write custom reports.</li>

                                    those with defects. I also assisted the Manager with inventory control, and area

                                <li>Overview: I started as a phone support technician, and was transferred to the email
                                    support group. I was promoted to the position of Supervisor in the RMA department.
                                    The department used a software package developed by previous supervisors who had
                                    no previous programming experience. In reviewing the software, I found it to be
                                    lacking in a number of key features, and spoke to my manager regarding the software.
                                    When I started in the department, the program tracked the clients name, address,
                                    and phone number, the RMA number and a general description of the product. Additional
                                    data was hand written on sheets of paper printed out when the product arrived. Printing
                                    these sheets out was also a manual process, in that the RMA had to be looked up
                                    based on the RMA number when provided, or the customers name if not. When I left
                                    the company, the RMA program allowed the support agent to enter the clients name,
                                    address, and phone number, and required a serial number in order to complete the
                                    process. The serial number would have to match a template as verification of the
                                    model number, thus giving us an exact card to match to. Upon arrival the receiving
                                    agent could scan the serial number bar code, and the system would match it to the
                                    RMA which would be verified by the receiving agent. In the event that the serial
                                    number didn't match due to input error, the RMA number could be manually looked
                                    up. Each station had a hand held scanner, and the product was scanned anytime it
                                    moved from one station to another. Test Codes, and Repair codes were used to determine
                                    what the product had undergone. At any point, we could look a product up in the
                                    system for a customer, and know precisely where it was at. When the product was
                                    shipped back out, the return was scanned in as well, and if an email address was
                                    on record, the client would receive an automated email to let them know the product
                                    had been shipped out, and what the UPS tracking code was. Additionally we could
                                    pull up statistics on employee performance, repair and replacement trends, as well
